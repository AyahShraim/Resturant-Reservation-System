# Restaurant Reservation System with EF Core and C#

## Overview

This project encompasses the creation of a Restaurant Reservation System using .NET  7.0, Entity Framework Core (EF Core) with C#, and Git for version control. Below are the essential functionalities covered in the project:

## Functionalities

1. **Database Structure:**
   - Set up a database named `RestaurantReservationCore` via SSMS.

2. **Project Structure:**
   - Initiated a console application, `RestaurantReservation`.
   - Crafted a refined library project, `RestaurantReservation.Db`, focusing on improved organization.

3. **Data Management:**
   - Modeled tables with comprehensive keys, relationships, constraints, and navigations within `RestaurantReservation.Db`.

4. **Migration Management:**
   - Created migrations within `RestaurantReservation.Db` to construct necessary tables.

5. **Data Seeding:**
   -  seeded tables with a minimum of 5 records each for optimal performance.

6. **Console Showcase:**
   - Demonstrated application functionality through the `RestaurantReservation` console app, highlighting method usage with sample data.

7. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Implemented essential `Create/Update/Delete` methods for each entity to manage data effectively.

8. **Additional Methods:**
   - Introduced crucial methods:
      - `ListManagers()`: Gathered all employees holding the "Manager" position.
      - `GetReservationsByCustomer(CustomerId)`: Retrieved reservations made by a specific customer.
      - `ListOrdersAndMenuItems(ReservationId)`: Displayed orders and associated menu items for a reservation.
      - `ListOrderedMenuItems(ReservationId)`: Identified menu items ordered within a specific reservation.
      - `CalculateAverageOrderAmount(EmployeeId)`: Calculated the average order amount for an employee.

9. **Views Exploration:**
   - Utilized EF Core to query a database view, presenting reservations with associated customer and restaurant details.
   - Formulated a query to extract employees alongside their respective restaurant information from a database view.

10. **Database Functions & Stored Procedures:**
   - Created a database function to calculate the total revenue generated by a specific restaurant using EF Core migrations.
   - Integrated the function call into `RestaurantReservation.Db`.
   - Designed a stored procedure to find customers who made reservations with a party size greater than a certain value, also implementing its execution in `RestaurantReservation.Db`.

11. **Repository Structure:**
   - Organized the project by introducing repository classes for each entity (`{EntityName}Repository.cs`) and relocating related methods to the `Repositories` folder within `RestaurantReservation.Db`.

## .NET 7 Compatibility

Ensured compatibility with .NET 7 to align with the latest framework version.
